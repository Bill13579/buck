E-ink devices have traditionally been only for reading... well no more!

**Buck** is a fully-fledged music player for e-ink devices (tested fully for the Kindle Touch).

Features:
- Using the generated Table of Contents, pick the song

- Afterwards, in the search bar, there are two commands you can do
- - `;b` - to open up the GUI
- - `;b 10` - to open up track `10` or whichever track of your choice

Playlist support is not planned at the moment!

First off, FBInk by NiLuJe bundled with USBnet (which btw is required for this)

I use the awesome `mplayer` binary built for the Kindle by the user `Smarter`
